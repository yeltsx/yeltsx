# Hello! 👋 I'm Yeltsin Lima

For 12 years, I built websites. Now, I'm building a new future. I'm a seasoned developer on a pilgrimage from the world of web frameworks to the core of Artificial Intelligence. This profile documents my journey of transformation, debugging my own life while learning to build intelligent systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning: The language of data through Python, the architecture of intelligence with TensorFlow/PyTorch, and the universal logic of math.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Projects that challenge me and have a meaningful impact. Open to contributing to research, open-source AI libraries, or simply learning alongside fellow travelers.

🤔 I’m seeking: Wisdom from those who have walked this path before. Looking for guidance on research methodologies and advanced AI concepts.

💬 Ask me about: The process of a major career pivot, the discipline of self-study, and how to start from scratch even after a decade of experience.

📫 How to reach me: yeltsin@disroot.org or visit my website www.yeltsin.com.br

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I'm on a mission to replace my console.log habit with a passion for cooking, jazz, and eventually, a view of the Recife skyline from my own apartment. My two cats are supervising the entire operation.
